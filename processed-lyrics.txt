oh yeah
i got the perfect song for the kids to sing
and all my people that's drug dealin' just to get by
stack your money 'til it get sky high
we wasn't s'posed to make it past twentyfive
joke's on you we still alive
throw your hands up in the sky and say
we don't care what people say
if this is your first time hearin' this
you are about to experience somethin' so cold man
we never had nothin' handed took nothin' for granted
took nothin' from no man man i'm my own man
but as a shorty i looked up to the dope man
only adult man i knew that wasn't broke man
flicking starter coats manman you don't know man
we don't care what people say
this is for my niggas outside all winter
'cause this summer they ain't finna say next summer i'm finna
sittin' in the hood like community colleges
this dope money here is lil' trey's scholarship
'cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
and ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
so we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
you gotta do somethin' man your ass is grown
this second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'cause a nigga can't shine off 655
and everybody sellin' makeup jacob's
and bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
we put shit on layaway then come back
we claim other people kids on our income tax
we take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
and we don't care what people say
mama say she wanna move south
scratching lottery tickets eyes on a new house
'round the same time doe ran up in dude house
couldn't get a job
so since he couldn't get work he figured he'd take work
the drug game bulimic it's hard to get weight
so niggas' money is homo it's hard to get straight
but we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
and we don't care what people say my niggas
you know the kids gon' act a fool
when you stop the programs for after school
and they dcfs some of 'em dyslexic
they favorite 50 cent song 12 questions
we scream rocks blow weed park see now we smart
we ain't retards the way teachers thought
hold up hold fast we make more cash
now tell my mama i belong in that slow class
it's bad enough we on welfare
you tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
i'm tryna get the car with the chromey wheels here
you tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
look what was handed us fathers abandoned us
when we get them hammers go on call the ambulance
sometimes i feel no one in this world understands us
but we don't care what people say my niggas
man i promise she's so selfconscious
she has no idea what she doin' in college
that major that she majored in don't make no money
but she won't drop out her parents'll look at her funny
now tell me that ain't insecurr
the concept of school seems so securr
sophomore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr
she like fuck it i'll just stay down hurr and do hair
'cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
of new airs 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
she's so precious with the peer pressure
couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter alexis
she had hair so long that it looked like weave
then she cut it all off now she look like eve
and she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
single black female addicted to retail and well
man i promise i'm so selfconscious
that's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
rollies and pashas done drove me crazy
i can't even pronounce nothing pass that versaysee
then i spent four hundred bucks on this
just to be like nigga you ain't up on this
and i can't even go to the grocery store
without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
it seem we livin' the american dream
but the people highest up got the lowest selfesteem
the prettiest people do the ugliest things
for the road to riches and diamond rings
we shine because they hate us floss 'cause they degrade us
we tryna buy back our 40 acres
and for that paper look how low we'll stoop
even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coupe
i say fuck the police that's how i treat 'em
we buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom
we'll buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need 'em
things we buy to cover up what's inside
'cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
that's why shorty's hollerin' where the ballers at
drug dealer buy jordan crackhead buy crack
and the white man get paid off of all of that
but i ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'cause fuck it i went to jacob with 25 thou
before i had a house and i'd do it again
cause i wanna be on 106 park pushin' a benz
i want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
i got a couple pastdue bills i won't get specific
i got a problem with spendin' before i get it
we all selfconscious i'm just the first to admit it
i've been working this graveshift
and i ain't made shit
i wish i could

or here to convert atheists into believers
i'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
the way kathie lee needed regis that's the way i need jesus
so here go my single dawg radio needs this

that right there could drive a sane man berserk
not to worry mr htotheizzo's back to wizerk
how can you console my mom or give her light support
when you're telling her her son on life support
and just imagine how my girl feel
on the plane scared as hell that her guy look like emmett till
she was with me before the deal she'd been trying to be mine

no use in me tryin' to be lyin' i been tryin' to be signed
tryin' to be a millionaire how i used two lifelines
in the same hospital where big and 2pac died
the doctor said i had blood clots but i ain't jamaican man
story on mtv and i ain't trying to make a band
i swear this right here history in the making man
what if somebody from the chi' that was ill got a deal
on the hottest rap label around
but he wasn't talking about coke and birds
it was more like spoken word
except he's really putting it down
and he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
and what we need to do in the game
good dude bad night right place wrong time
in the blink of a eye his whole life changed
if you could feel how my face felt

at the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sitins
and with that in my blood i was born to be different

fit three in the bed if it's six of y'all
i'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
but you ain't have to tell my girl i used to pee in the bed
i woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
a creative way to rhyme without using nines and guns
keep your nose out the sky keep your heart to god
and keep your face to the risin' sun
all my niggas from the chi' is my family dawg
and my niggas ain't my guys they my family dawg
i feel like one day you'll understand me dawg
you can still love your man and be manly dawg
you ain't gotta get heated at every housewarmin'

y'all gon' sit down have a good time this reunion
and drink some wine like communion
and act like everything fine and if it isn't
we ain't letting everybody in our family business uh
the all around the world digital underground pac
the rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the roc
i take my chain my fifteen seconds of fame
and come back next year with the whole fucking game
ain't nobody expect kanye to end up on top
they expected that college dropout to drop and then flop
then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
rocafella's only niggas that helped
my money was thinner than sean paul's goatee hair
now jean paul gaultier cologne fill the air here
they say he bougie he bigheaded
would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
flow infectious give me ten seconds
i'll have a buzz bigger than insects in texas
it's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'til the night i almost killed myself in lexus
now was kanye the most overlooked yes sir
now is kanye the most overbooked yes sir
though the fans want the feeling of a tribe called quest
but all they got left is this guy called west
that'll take freeway throw him on tracks with mos def
call him kwali or kweli i put him on songs with jayz
i'm the gap like banana republic and old navy and oooh
it come out sweeter than old sadie
nice as bunb when i met him at the source awards
girl he had with him ass coulda won the horse awards
and i was almost famous now everybody love kanye
i'm almost raymond
some say he arrogant can y'all blame him
it was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
last year shoppin' my demo i was tryin' to shine
every motherfucker told me that i couldn't rhyme
now i could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
i use it as my gas so they say that i'm gassed
but without it i'd be last so i ought to laugh
so i don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
you niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
you can't say shit to kanye west no more
i rocked 20000 people i was just on tour nigga
i'm kon the louis vuitton don
bought my mom a purse now she louis vuitton mom
i ain't play the hand i was dealt i changed my cards
i prayed to the skies and i changed my stars
i went to the malls and i balled too hard
oh my god is that a black card
i turned around and replied why yes
but i prefer the term african american express
brains power and muscle
like dame puffy and russell
your boy back on his hustle
you know what i've been up to
killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
mayonnaisecolored benz i push miracle whips
i'm like oh shit i was messin' with uh ddot also people were like this started talking about the ghost production but that's how i got in the game if it wasn't for that i wouldn't be here so you know after they picked that truth beat i was figuring i was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that i was stayin' in chicago i had my own apartment i be doin' like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off layaway get some jordans or something or get a technomarine that's what we wore back then i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample i played it for hip over the phone he's like oh yo that shit is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he doin' called the dynasty and at that time like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic 2001 at that time and really i just like bit the drums off xxplosive and put it like with a spedup sample and now it's kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this can't be life
and that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound you know i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management i really wanted to roll with hip hop 'cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what i'm sayin' 'cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change try to move up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jayz and he said oh you a real soulful dude
and i heard 'em say
nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
from the chi like tim it's a harder way
so this is in the name of love like robert say
before you ask me to go get a job today
can i at least get a raise on the minimum wage
and i know the government administer aids
so i guess we just pray like the minister say
allhu akbar and throw in some hot cars
the things we seen on the screen is not ours
but these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
where i'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
but they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
i guess they want us all behind barsi know it
they say people in your life are seasons
and anything that happen is for a reason
and niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
and gran keep praying and keep believing
in jesus and one day that you see him
'til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
the devil is alive i feel him breathin'
claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin'
and put them lottery tickets just to tease us
my aunt pam can't put them cigarettes down
so now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
his job try to claim that he too niggerish now
is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now
i can't figure it out i'm sick of it now
i gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'fore the day i die i'ma touch the sky
gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'fore the day i die i'ma touch the sky
back when they thought pink polos would hurt the roc

and walked around the mall with his radio face off
plus he had the spinner from his daytons in his hand
keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man

right now she'd be okay
but since she was just a secretary
working for the church for 35 years

but every time i wanted layaway or a deposit
my dad'd say when you see clothes close your eyelids

'cause every summer he'd get some
brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from

i think he did
when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
just a lil' somethin' show ya how we live
everything i wanted man it seem so serious

role in chicago like queen latifah
i'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like killa cam
or rock some mink boots in the summertime like william

y'all bridesmaids catch the garter
on nights when 'ye romance cameras flash so much
that i gotta do that yayo dance
i'm on a world tour with common my man
after each and every show a couple dykes in the van
it's easy the hood love to listen to jeezy and weezy
and oh yeah yeezy i did it for the glory
what i'm supposed to do now man the game all messed up
how i'm suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
so yeah at the grammys i went ultra travolta
yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
but with my ego i can stand there in a speedo
and be looked at like a fucking hero
the glory the story the chain the polo the night
the grind the empty bottles of nodoz
tank on empty whipping my momma volvo
i spent that gas money on clothes with logos
the fur is hermes shit that you don't floss
the goyard so hard man i'm hugo's boss
why i gotta ask what that tudor cost
house on the hill two doors from tracee ross
and i'm asking 'bout her girlfriends yeah the dark skin'ed ones
she asking 'bout the speed boats yeah i admit we rented 'em
when you meet me in person what do you feel like
i know i know i look better in real life
i hear people compare themselves to big a lot
you know big and pac you know to get it hot
i guess after i live i wanna be compared to big
any one big pun big l or notorious
'till then get money and stunt and stay glorious
and i'm gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
yeah i'ma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit uh

yeah
and you say chi city
chi city chi city
i'm comin' home again
do you think about me now and then yeah
do you think about me now and then
'cause i'm comin' home again ow
min' home again
i met this girl when i was three years old
and what i loved most she had so much soul
she said excuse me little homie i know you don't know me but
my name is windy and i like to blow trees and
from that point i'd never blow her off
niggas come from out of town i like to show her off
they like to act tough she like to tow 'em off
and make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
and when i grew up she showed me how to go downtown
in the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin'
i told her in my heart is where she'll always be
she never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
she said it felt like they walked and drove on me
knew i was gang affiliated got on tv and told on me
i guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
she said ye keep makin' that keep makin' that platinum and gold for me
but if you really cared for her
then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
sometimes i still talk to her
but when i talk to her it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
she said you left your kids and they just like you
they wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
but they just not you and i just got through
talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
i guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
i guess that's why i'm here and i can't come back home
and guess when i heard that when i was back home
every interview i'm representin' you makin' you proud
reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave 'em around
if you don't know by now i'm talkin' 'bout chitown
my big brother was big's brother
used to be dame and biggs' brother
who was hip hop brother who was no id friend
no id my mentor now let the story begin
it's the hard knock life tour sellout
picture us in the mall coppin' iceberg and yell out jigga
yeah that's what we'll yell out yell out
you know the name do i gotta spell out or tell 'bout
jay and 'ye so shy
that he won't even step to his idol to say hi
standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
back of my mind he could change your life
with all these beats i did at least let him hear it
at least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
but he got me out my momma crib
then he help me get my momma a crib
fresh off the plane i'm off to baseline
nothing handed out i'm 'bout to take mine
'round the same time of that blueprint 1
and these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
i'd play my little songs in that old back room
he'd bob his head and say damn oh that's you
but by the black album i was blacking out
partyin' sob's and we had packed a crowd
big brother got his show up at madison square
and i'm like yeah yeah we gon' be there but
not only did i not get a chance to spit it
carline told me i could buy two tickets
i guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
and kept little brother at bay at a distance
but everything that i felt was more bogus
only made me more focused only wrote more potent
only thing i wanna know is why i get looked over
i guess i'll understand when i get more older
big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
now i'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum
have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
not only a client the presidito hola hovito
the game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
i was always on the other side of the peephole
then i dropped jesus walks now i'm on the steeple
and we know new jack citygot to keep my brother
but to be number one i'ma beat my brother
on that diamonds remix i swore i spazzed
then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
sibling rivalry only i could see
it was the pride in me that was drivin' me
at the grammys i said i inspired me
but my big brother who i always tried to be
when i kicked a flow it was like pickandroll
'cause even if he gave me the rock it's giveandgo
i guess beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
and my shit was more like a finger roll
but i had them singles though
and them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh y'all know
i told jay i did a song with coldplay
next thing i know he got a song with coldplay
back in my mind i'm like damn no way
translate espaol no way jos
then i went and told jay brown
shoulda known that was gon' come back around
shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
but i told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
why would she make calls out the blue
now i'm awake sleep less in june or missing you
hey hey hey hey
don't say you will unless you will
hey hey hey hey
don't say you will then play you will i pray you will
mrs so fly crashlands in my room
can't waste no time she might leave soon
when i grab your neck i touch your soul
take off your cool then lose control
i wish this song would really come true
i admit i still fantasize about you about you
my friend showed me pictures of his kids
and all i could show him was pictures of my cribs
he said his daughter got a brand new report card card
and all i got was a brand new sports car oh
dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
but i couldn't hear him all the way in first class
chased the good life my whole life long
look back on my life and my life gone
where did i go wrong
i've seen it i've seen it before
my godsister getting married by the lake
but i couldn't figure out who i'd wanna take
bad enough that i showed up late
i had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
welcome to heartbreak
in the night i hear 'em talk
the coldest story ever told
somewhere far along this road
he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
how could you be so heartless
oh how could you be so heartless
how could you be so
cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo

intercentury anthems based off innercity tantrums
based off the way we was branded

you'll probably find one of them 'i like art'type girls
all of the lights she was caught in the hype girl
and i was satisfied bein' in love with a lie
now who to blame you to blame
me to blame for the pain
and it poured every time when it rained
things used to be now they not
anything but us is who we are
disguising ourselves as secret lovers
we've become public enemies
we walk away like strangers in the street
gone for eternity
we erased one another
so far from where we came
with so much of everything
how do we leave with nothing
lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of love
hatred and attitude tear us entirely
